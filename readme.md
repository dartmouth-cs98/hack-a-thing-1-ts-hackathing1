### What I attempted to build:
I attempted to create a basic ios app from scratch by learning react-native because I have never coded in react/JS before. I played around with all sorts of components and learned how to work with props, states, flexboxes, text input, touches and more to get used to how they all work. I made a main page for my app using several of these different features to a) learn how to combine them as opposed to implementing them individually and b) learn how to edit the code for them to tweak things to make them what I wanted. 

### Who Did What:  
I did everything


### What I Learned:
I learned about all of the different basic elements of a react native app and about what their code looks like and what it does. I played around with the code a lot to familiarize myself with concepts, and ended up coding my app from scratch instead of copying and pasting code to fully understand where stuff needed to go for the code to run. I learned the language through these tutorials which was at first very unfamiliar to me as I have no experience in coding apps/web-apps, but by the end I understood components, views, how to have different classes and more. I feel like I now have a solid basic understanding of what react native is and how it works, and all of these tutorials + other articles I used to find solutions to tweak my app helped me gain a better understanding of it all. I also refamiliarized myself with how to use git and encountered many issues because I have 2 github accounts but after a lot of debugging have a better memory of how it works and of the different commands.


### What Didn't Work:
One thing I wanted to do that I couldn't figure out was fixing the contents of my app in the middle of the screen and then having the page be a scrolling page, as opposed to all the content going to the top. I tried to find solutions for this but my searches kept coming up with stuff on scrollview which I already understood and had gotten working.
